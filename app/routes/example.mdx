# MDX Content Example

This page demonstrates **MDX** (Markdown + JSX) in action. You can write regular markdown with all its features:

## Features

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links](/) to other pages
- Lists and formatting
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

## Code Example

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello from MDX!"
console.log(greeting)
```

## Why Use MDX?

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. You can:

1. Write content in Markdown
2. Import and use React components
3. Mix both seamlessly in the same file

This makes it perfect for blog posts, documentation, and content-rich pages where you need occasional interactivity.
