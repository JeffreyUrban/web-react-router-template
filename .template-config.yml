# Template Customization Configuration
#
# This file defines what gets customized when this template is integrated into a monorepo.
# The template remains fully functional and deployable on its own - these are just markers
# for what should be replaced during integration.
#
# Available replacement variables:
#   - project_slug: lowercase-with-hyphens (e.g., "my-awesome-app")
#   - project_name: user-friendly name (e.g., "My Awesome App")

customizations:
  # Fly.io app name
  - file: fly.toml
    find: 'web-react-router-template'
    replace_with: 'project_slug'

  # Fly.io review app names in workflow
  - file: .github/workflows/fly-review.yml
    find: 'pr-${{ github.event.number }}-web-react-router-template'
    replace_with: 'pr-${{ github.event.number }}-{project_slug}'

  # Package name (uses JSON path for structured replacement)
  - file: package.json
    json_path: 'name'
    replace_with: 'project_slug'

  # README title
  - file: README.md
    find: '# React Router Template with Tailwind CSS'
    replace_with: '# {project_name}'
